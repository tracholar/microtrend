As the company grew, they needed hardware to protect their software against piracy. I was still working in Asia, and they asked me to help by making phone calls and doing research. In 1986, they sold AsiaTek to Yung Tay Engineering.Steve registered Sony Inc. in the United States in late 1988. Around that time, I quit Acer and went to work as a sportswriter for a Chinese daily newspaper to cover living expenses while I prepared to open the Taiwan office of Sony the next year.
